WORKIFI:

Workifi is a simple program to automate attachment file uploads to Workiom.
Provide it with your credentials & upload details in `config.json', a list of
files to upload and the record names you want to upload them to in
`list.json', then run `workifi' and off you go.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LIMITATIONS:

Note that version 2.0.0 only supports tenants with custom S3 storage enabled.
If you have a normal tenant, then please use version 1.0.0 instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOWNLOAD:

You can download binary packages of Workifi for GNU/Linux or Windows from the
GitHub releases page (https://github.com/workiom/workifi/releases).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES:

  * WINDOWS: If you download and use the binary release for Windows, then
    there's no dependencies to worry about; the release is built statically.

  * GNU/Linux: Using the pre-built binary releases on GNU/Linux requires
    having the libcurl and json-c shared libraries installed; the build is
    dynamically linked. The install instructions can change depending on your
    GNU/Linux distribution of course.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BUILDING FROM SOURCE:

To build Workifi from the source distribution you will need the development
headers for libcurl and json-c installed (depending on your distribution, they
can be included in the library packages, or separately in -dev packages). You
can then use the usual `./configure && make && make install' to build Workifi.

To build on Windows you will need those libraries built for MinGW. The easiest
way to get them is installing MSYS2 and then using its package manager.

You can use the helper scripts in `/contrib' for building binary packages.

If you want to build Workifi statically, you will need the dependencies be
compiled as static libraries. You can download them and compile them yourself
for further customisation. Workifi for Windows was built and tested with
`curl-7.82.0' and `json-c-json-c-0.13.1-20180305'.

To build a minimal libcurl, appropriate for Workifi static linking, you can
configure libcurl as follows:

    ./configure --disable-libcurl-option --disable-verbose --disable-alt-svc \
                --disable-mqtt --disable-file --disable-debug --disable-ftp \
                --disable-ldap --disable-ldaps --disable-rtsp --disable-proxy \
                --disable-dict --disable-telnet --disable-tftp --disable-pop3 \
                --disable-imap --disable-smb --disable-smtp --disable-gopher \
                --disable-manual --disable-ipv6 --disable-sspi \
                --disable-crypto-auth --disable-ntlm-wb --disable-tls-srp \
                --without-nghttp2 --without-libidn2 --without-libssh2 \
                --without-brotli --disable-shared --enable-static \
                --without-nghttp2 --disable-ldap --disable-ldaps \
                --disable-rtsp --with-schannel --without-ssl --with-zlib \
                CFLAGS="-static" CPPFLAGS="-DCURL_STATIC"

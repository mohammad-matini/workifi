	Add release script; auto-generates all packages & dists.

	Add MinGW cross-compiling script, minor build script improvements.

	Use pkg-config configure macros for library checks.
		This simplifies the build configuration a lot, and makes it
		easier to build for other platforms, like Windows, without
		having to specify linked libraries manually like we were doing
		before.

	Remove the autogen.sh script, it is unnecessary.
		Scripts in contrib/ can now call autoreconf internally instead.

	Prevent crashes if a file could not be opened.
		If not found, no premission, or any other reason.  Instead, we
		now continue to the next file in the upload queue.  This was the
		case in version 1.0.0, but we had a regression in version 2.0.0.

	Add distribution archives to .gitignore.

	Added README, NEWS, AUTHORS, and COPYING files.

	Flush stdout in addition to flushing the logs on writelog.

	Add script to build workifi on GNU/Linux as dynamic executable.

	Add example config files, script to build on Windows using MinGW.
		The script builds a static version of workifi for Windows using
		MinGW.  Note that this is intended for compilation on Windows,
		and not for cross-compiling from a GNU/Linux system.

	Fix minor error in URL configuration key.

	Replace win-specific I64 format strings with standard PRIi64.

2022-02-28  Mohammad Matini  <mohammad.matini@outlook.com>

	mime.c: Include strings.h to get strncasecmp()
		strings.h and string.h are different headers. We get implicit
		declaration warnings because strncasecmp() belongs to the first.

	mime.c: Use safer comparison, statically size array.
		The mime array size doesn't need to be calculated on every
		function call, it is a static value that does not change. Also,
		use the safer variant of the case-insensitive string comparison
		function.

	Use new Workiom direct external upload API.
		To avoid limits on file upload size for tenants with custom S3
		storage.

2022-02-22  Mohammad Matini  <mohammad.matini@outlook.com>

	Get base API URL from URLs config: file.
		instead of hard-coded value.

2022-02-21  Mohammad Matini  <mohammad.matini@outlook.com>

	Remove various generated autotools build files.
		Those files can be be re-built with ./autogen.sh.

	Some minor refactoring, an attempt to solve Windows heap corruption.

2020-03-11  Mohammad Matini  <mohammad.matini@outlook.com>

	Some minor refactoring, an attempt to solve Windows heap corruption.

	Use local-time to name logs instead of UTC.

	Fix time formatting on Windows.
		Although the docs say otherwise, it seems like %F and %T are not
		working on Windows. Used their equivalents.

	Minor tweak to the loading animation.
		Having the carriage-return at the end of every frame allows the
		"upload successful" message to appear on top of the loading bar
		on Windows (On Linux, the end message replaced the loader
		without any changes... oh well).

	Support missing directory creation on Windows.

	Some refactoring for better error handling, added a greeter.

	Added file-based logging support.

2020-03-10  Mohammad Matini  <mohammad.matini@outlook.com>

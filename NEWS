New in 2.0.1:

* Bug fixes

  - Prevent crashes if a file could not be opened (not found, or no
    premission, or any other reason).  Instead, we continue to the next
    file in the upload queue. This was the case in version 1.0.0, but we
    had a regression in version 2.0.0.

* Miscellaneous changes

  - Additional improvements to the build system, this streamlines the
    release process, and makes it easier to cross-compile to Windows.

New in 2.0.0:

* New features added

  - Remove limits on file upload size for tenants with custom S3 storage,
    by using Workiom's new external-upload API. This release does not 
    support tenants without custom storage; if you have such a tenant use
    version 1.0.0 instead until support is re-added in future versions.

* Miscellaneous changes

  - Remove autotools auto-generated files, and added autogen.sh instead.
  - Add example config files & helper build scripts for MinGW & GNU/Linux.
  - Various minor changes & code improvements.

New in 1.0.0:

* Initial release of Workifi
